# Indian-Recipe-Machine-Learning
n this project, I dug in a dataset of the Indian recipe from : http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/xsphgmmh7b.1. explore with many methods of ml algo and some Nlp
The dataset has following fields (self-explanatory) - ['RecipeName', 'TranslatedRecipeName', 'Ingredients', 'TranslatedIngredients', 'Prep', 'Cook', 'Total', 'Servings', 'Cuisine', 'Course', 'Diet', 'Instructions', 'TranslatedInstructions']

I was explore the TotalTimeInMins, time required to prepare a dish,the common ingredients, different cuisines, diets, courses and other.
I perform several ML algorithms on the dataset some for classification and other for prediction and some clustering.
I was generated some recipes using markovify package.
The main goals were to enhance my EDA and visualization skills and get explore with whenever i would like to go and seek with some help of ML and other methods, as well as learn where the magical indian recipes. 
Do note - I ran everything on Google Colab.
